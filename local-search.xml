The first was that my work shifted to the field of LLM, which I had never encountered before😵. Essentially, my first day at Tencent marked the beginning of my journey into LLM. The second shock was the exceptionally high academic qualifications within the team, with degrees primarily from Tsinghua and top 985 universities at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels😥. This was the first time I realized just how high the threshold for data science is. Nonetheless, this is a highly valuable experience, and with a sense of gratitude and perseverance, I’m gradually integrating into my work🤲🏻.</p><p><img src="/img/t4.png" alt="working environment"></p><p><img src="/img/t3.png" alt="entry day"></p><h3 id="LLM-Research"><a href="#LLM-Research" class="headerlink" title="LLM Research"></a>LLM Research</h3><p>Half of my work involves collaborating with the experts from the neighboring machine learning algorithm team. One of the most striking things for me is the remarkable combination: top-tier experts paired with someone as inexperienced as I am🥶. Some individuals may speak infrequently, but when they do, their words carry immense weight and value.</p><p><img src="/img/t8.png"></p><h3 id="Agent-Development"><a href="#Agent-Development" class="headerlink" title="Agent Development"></a>Agent Development</h3><p>The other half of my work involves developing intelligent agents to embed into products. The product is already live internally and should be publicly released in the near future🤔. During the busiest times, I developed three features in a single week, pushing over 1,000 lines of code. Fortunately, things have been relatively relaxed recently, which inspired me to tinker with my own blog🌴.</p><p><img src="/img/t9.png" alt="most of time"></p>]]></content>
