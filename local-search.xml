Maybe it was because there were so few girls, and I only had one close friend who I really clicked with😢.</p><p><img src="/img/use6.png" alt="training"></p><p>It wasn’t until sophomore year that I gradually found my direction and rhythm. Of course, I would also go to the other main campus to attend concerts and social events😍.</p><p><img src="/img/use7.png" alt="campus concert"></p><p>Junior year was the most interesting for me—I finally left Chengdu, a city I wasn’t very fond of🥲, and as I started my internship, I experienced living independently for the first time🥳.</p><p><img src="/img/use8.png"></p><h3 id="Best-friend-in-Uestc"><a href="#Best-friend-in-Uestc" class="headerlink" title="Best friend in Uestc"></a>Best friend in Uestc</h3><p>Eat delicious food every weekend～</p><p><img src="/img/food.png"></p>]]></content>
